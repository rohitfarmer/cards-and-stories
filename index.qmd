# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Cards & Stories — a collection born from a love of postcards: those small, often humble pieces that carry entire worlds of memory, place, and connection. To me, postcards have always been more than souvenirs. They are fragments of journeys, delicate keepsakes that bridge distances with an image and a few thoughtful words.

Some of the postcards within these pages are ones I’ve collected as mementos from my own travels; others have found their way to me from friends, colleagues, and kind strangers who thought of me during their adventures. Together, they form a living tapestry of experiences — snapshots of landscapes, landmarks, and lives, each card carrying its own quiet story.

This collection is an invitation to pause and journey with me through these postcards — to see how something so simple can open a window into faraway worlds, and how stories, whether our own or entrusted to us by others, can bring us closer together. My hope is that as you turn these pages, you’ll feel the same sense of wonder, nostalgia, and connection that inspired their collection.
