# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Cards & Stories. This book is born from a love of postcards—those small, often humble pieces of paper that carry with them a world of memory, place, and connection. For me, postcards have always been more than souvenirs. They are fragments of journeys, delicate keepsakes that bridge distance with an image and a few thoughtful words.

Some of the cards in these pages I collected as mementos from the places I’ve traveled; others arrived in my mailbox from friends who remembered me during their own adventures. Together, they form a tapestry of shared experiences—snapshots of landscapes, landmarks, and lives, each carrying its own quiet story.

This collection is an invitation to pause and journey with me through these postcards, to see how something so simple can open a window into faraway worlds, and how stories—whether our own or entrusted to us by others—bring us closer together. May you find in these pages the same sense of wonder, nostalgia, and connection that inspired their collection.
