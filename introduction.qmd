# Introduction

Long before instant messages, emails, and video calls, there was the humble [postcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcard)—a small, sturdy piece of paper that carried big stories across great distances. The first known postcard was sent in 1840 in London, but it was in 1869 that Austria officially introduced the postcard as a simple, affordable way for people to communicate. What began as a practical solution for quick correspondence soon evolved into something far more meaningful: an art form, a travel souvenir, a collectible, and a cherished keepsake.

Over the years, postcards became a reflection of the world itself—capturing history, landscapes, culture, and personal stories in a way no other medium could. They carried snapshots of faraway cities, photographs of iconic landmarks, and glimpses of everyday life. During times of war, postcards brought comfort to families separated by oceans. During times of peace, they sparked wanderlust, inspiring people to explore unfamiliar corners of the globe. Each one, however simple, carried the weight of someone’s thoughts, memories, and intentions.

Collecting postcards became more than a hobby—it became a way to travel without moving, to hold pieces of the world in your hands. Enthusiasts carefully curate collections that span continents and centuries, preserving tiny fragments of history and human connection. Each card tells two stories: one of the image on the front and another of the message on the back—a story of who sent it, where they were, and why they thought of you.

In today’s hyper-digital age, where messages disappear with a swipe, postcards stand out as intentional acts of connection. They require effort. You pause to choose the card, write a few thoughtful words, find the right stamp, and send it into the unknown—trusting it will eventually arrive in someone else’s hands. That slowness makes postcards deeply human. They are more than paper and ink; they are little time capsules, reminders that someone, somewhere, stopped for a moment to think of you.

This book is a celebration of that magic—the way postcards connect strangers, strengthen friendships, and preserve memories. It’s about the journeys they’ve taken, the stories they carry, and the surprising ways they bring people closer together. Each postcard in these pages is more than just an image; it’s a conversation between two places, two hearts, and sometimes, two completely different worlds.

So, turn the page.
Let these postcards take you across mountains and oceans, deserts and ice fields, cities and quiet villages. Because within each one lies a reminder: sometimes the smallest pieces of paper hold the biggest stories.
