    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to Cards & Stories — a collection born from a love of postcards: those small, often humble pieces that carry entire worlds of memory, place, and connection. To me, postcards have always been more than souvenirs. They are fragments of journeys, delicate keepsakes that bridge distances with an image and a few thoughtful words.\nSome of the postcards within these pages are ones I’ve collected as mementos from my own travels; others have found their way to me from friends, colleagues, and kind strangers who thought of me during their adventures. Together, they form a living tapestry of experiences — snapshots of landscapes, landmarks, and lives, each card carrying its own quiet story.\nThis collection is an invitation to pause and journey with me through these postcards — to see how something so simple can open a window into faraway worlds, and how stories, whether our own or entrusted to us by others, can bring us closer together. My hope is that as you turn these pages, you’ll feel the same sense of wonder, nostalgia, and connection that inspired their collection.\nThis Website is Under Active Development and on Testing Mode",

    "text": "Pursuing the Postcard Collecting Hobby\nLong before instant messages, emails, and video calls, there was the humble postcard—a small, sturdy piece of paper that carried big stories across great distances. The first known postcard was sent in 1840 in London, but it was in 1869 that Austria officially introduced the postcard as a simple, affordable way for people to communicate. What began as a practical solution for quick correspondence soon evolved into something far more meaningful: an art form, a travel souvenir, a collectible, and a cherished keepsake.\nOver the years, postcards became a reflection of the world itself—capturing history, landscapes, culture, and personal stories in a way no other medium could. They carried snapshots of faraway cities, photographs of iconic landmarks, and glimpses of everyday life. During times of war, postcards brought comfort to families separated by oceans. During times of peace, they sparked wanderlust, inspiring people to explore unfamiliar corners of the globe. Each one, however simple, carried the weight of someone’s thoughts, memories, and intentions.\nCollecting postcards became more than a hobby—it became a way to travel without moving, to hold pieces of the world in your hands. Enthusiasts carefully curate collections that span continents and centuries, preserving tiny fragments of history and human connection. Each card tells two stories: one of the image on the front and another of the message on the back—a story of who sent it, where they were, and why they thought of you.\nIn today’s hyper-digital age, where messages disappear with a swipe, postcards stand out as intentional acts of connection. They require effort. You pause to choose the card, write a few thoughtful words, find the right stamp, and send it into the unknown—trusting it will eventually arrive in someone else’s hands. That slowness makes postcards deeply human. They are more than paper and ink; they are little time capsules, reminders that someone, somewhere, stopped for a moment to think of you.\nThis book is a celebration of that magic—the way postcards connect strangers, strengthen friendships, and preserve memories. It’s about the journeys they’ve taken, the stories they carry, and the surprising ways they bring people closer together. Each postcard in these pages is more than just an image; it’s a conversation between two places, two hearts, and sometimes, two completely different worlds.\nSo, turn the page.\nLet these postcards take you across mountains and oceans, deserts and ice fields, cities and quiet villages. Because within each one lies a reminder: sometimes the smallest pieces of paper hold the biggest stories.\nCollecting postcards is more than gathering paper souvenirs—it is a way of preserving travel, memory, and human connection in a tangible form. For anyone wishing to begin this hobby, the first step is simply to remain curious: look for postcards not only in tourist shops, but also in museums, antique stores, flea markets, and even modern bookstores that still carry regional cards. Every card has a story, whether it was picked up on a trip or sent across the world by a friend.",

Cards can be sorted by country, theme, or year.\nDigital Scans: Scanning at 300 dpi (or higher) ensures you have a lasting digital copy—helpful for sharing and preserving fragile or rare cards.\n\n\n\nDisplaying and Sharing\n\nFraming: Select a few favorites to frame; rotating them keeps the display fresh.\nShadow Boxes: Deeper frames allow postcards to be paired with stamps, tickets, or small travel mementos.\nCreative Projects: Many collectors create coffee-table books, websites, or blogs to share their stories—just as this book does.\n\nPursuing postcard collecting is not about amassing the largest number of cards, but about cultivating stories, connections, and memories. Each card you collect becomes part of a larger narrative: a global conversation carried on in ink, image, and stamp.",

    "text": "As you turn the final page of Cards & Stories, I hope you’ve glimpsed not just postcards, but the journeys, friendships, and memories they carry. Each card, whether collected in person or received from afar, is part of a larger story that continues to unfold.\nThis book is not an ending, but a pause—an open invitation for new postcards, new places, and new voices to join its pages. May it remind you that even the smallest tokens of travel can hold the greatest stories, and that our connections, like postcards, are meant to be shared and cherished across time and distance.\nUntil the next postcard finds its way here…",
