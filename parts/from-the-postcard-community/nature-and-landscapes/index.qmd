![Postmarked April 2025, with the message "Hi Rohit! Well, I meant to send this before my trip to PA but chances are you'll get the other postcard first. Thank you for the San Diego card! I went there once and I only remember thinking how warm the water was compared to how cold the water was in Half Moon Bay in the Bay Area. Ofcourse, Co is land locked so no beaches for me here! Hope today is sunny + gorgeous!
