![Postmarked September 15, 2025, with the message "Hi Rohit! Whitby abbey is famous for being the inspiration behind Dracula by Bram Stoker. Stoker stayed in Whitby in the 1890s and loved the gothic atmosphere of the abbey and it's graveyard so he set his novel here. It's very beautiful to visit and at Halloween it's lit up at night in all different colours. Best wishes, Lucy"](whitby-back-address-crop.webp){fig-alt="Back of the postcard with a message from the sender as mentioned in the figure caption" group="whitby"}
