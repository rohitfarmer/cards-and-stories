# PART III. From the Postcard Community

Postcards have a way of creating connections with people we may never meet in person. Through exchanges, online communities, and shared curiosity, these cards found their way into my collection â€” each carrying a voice from afar and reminding me how small the world can feel when a simple note travels across oceans and lands to arrive in my mailbox.
