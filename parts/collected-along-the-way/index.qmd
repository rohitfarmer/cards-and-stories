# PART III: Collected Along the Way

This section brings together postcards I personally collected along the way — from cities I’ve wandered, museums I’ve explored, quiet trails and rugged coastlines, and national parks that left a lasting impression. For me, postcards are more than part of a hobby; they’re the perfect souvenir — light to carry, cost-effective, long-lasting, and easy to tuck into a bag while traveling. On the back, I often note the place, the date, and the people I was with, turning each card into a little time capsule of memory.

To keep this section focused, postcards already featured in the *PART I. Favourites* section are not repeated here, allowing these pages to showcase the rest of the collection gathered from moments and places that continue to shape my journeys.
