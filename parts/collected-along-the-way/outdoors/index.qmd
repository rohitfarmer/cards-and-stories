# Trails, Parks & Coasts

*There’s a quiet magic in the outdoors — in the way trails wind into forests, waves roll onto forgotten shores, and sunlight filters through old trees. These postcards were collected on hikes, SUP adventures, coastal getaways, and national park visits — little fragments of wild places I’ve been fortunate to wander through.*

I had always wanted to camp at Assateague Island, and after keeping an eye on reservations for a couple of months, I finally had the chance to spend a night in the state park. Assateague is one of Maryland’s natural gems — a place that feels magical in every season. I also recorded the experience and shared it in a YouTube video, which you can find [here](https://youtu.be/ZxtUDb7nsYw?si=OCVdYA16bd1c_OU8).

Shenandoah was the first national park I visited in the United States. I’ve been there twice — the first time on my own, while my family was in India, when I hiked Blackrock Summit, Dark Hollow Falls, and the famous Old Rag. The second time I returned with my family to see the fall colors, which were breathtaking both from Skyline Drive and down in the valley.

Much like Shenandoah National Park, I’ve visited Luray Caverns twice — once on my own and once with my family. The two often go hand in hand, especially on a two-day trip when staying just outside the park: one day exploring Shenandoah, and the next day, before heading home, venturing into the caverns.

At Catoctin Mountain Park, I hiked to Chimney Rock, where the trail leads through quiet forest before opening to sweeping views over the Blue Ridge landscape. A simple climb, but one that lingers in memory for its beauty and sense of peace.
