# Trails, Parks & Coasts

*There’s a quiet magic in the outdoors — in the way trails wind into forests, waves roll onto forgotten shores, and sunlight filters through old trees. These postcards were collected on hikes, SUP adventures, coastal getaways, and national park visits — little fragments of wild places I’ve been fortunate to wander through.*
