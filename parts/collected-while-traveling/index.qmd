# PART III: Collected While Traveling

This section brings together the postcards I collected during my own travels—whether from countries and cities I visited, museums I wandered through, or national parks I explored. Beyond my postcard-collecting hobby, I also see postcards as the perfect souvenir: they are light to carry, cost-effective, long-lasting, and easy to bring home. On the back I can note the place, the date, and the people I was with—making them far more meaningful to me than most other souvenirs. To avoid repetition, postcards highlighted in the Favourites section do not appear here
