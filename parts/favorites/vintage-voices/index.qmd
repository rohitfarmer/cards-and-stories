# Vintage Voices

*A vintage postcard is a window to another time. Faded ink, sepia tones, and worn corners reveal stories from decades past, carrying with them the aesthetics, language, and spirit of their era. These cards remind us that every journey, no matter how old, continues to speak across the years.*

I found this vintage postcard there, and I thought it'd be unique among the cards in your collection. I think if you put your nose close enough, it smells old! If I can't get it mailed here, it'll go out with the CO one on Monday. Have a great week! - Eliza G (omgwtflols)"](pennsylvania-back-address-crop-may-2025.webp){fig-alt="back of a postcard with a message" group="waynehall"}

Two Redditors sent these postcard in response to my post in the [r/PostCardExchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostCardExchange/comments/1k40wwu/i_am_from_maryland_and_am_trying_to_collect/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) subreddit, requesting postcards from all the US states for my [collection](https://rohitfarmer.com/posts/2025/collecting-usa-postcards/). I do not know how old these postcards are, but they definitely look and smell vintage.
