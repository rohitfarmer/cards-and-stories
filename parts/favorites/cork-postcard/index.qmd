This postcard is truly one of a kind—the only one in my collection that isn’t made of paper. Sent by my colleague Sucheta during her vacation in Porto, Portugal, it’s crafted entirely from cork, a material Portugal is famous for. The front features a vibrant mosaic pattern, beautifully capturing the charm and artistic spirit of Porto. Its unique texture and design make it a special keepsake, standing out as both a postcard and a little piece of Portugal itself.
