# The Language of Stamps

*Postcards travel not only through the images they carry, but also through the stamps affixed to them. Each stamp is a miniature work of art, a symbol of its country, and a trace of its journey across the world. In this section, the focus shifts to those tiny emblems of history and culture—the stamps and postmarks—that make every postcard feel alive with movement, time, and place.*
