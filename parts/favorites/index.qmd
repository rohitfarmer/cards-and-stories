# PART I. Favorites

This section presents a selection of my most cherished postcardsâ€”the ones that stand out for their stories, design, or the memories they carry. To keep the collection clear and non-repetitive, postcards shown here do not appear in their usual thematic or geographic sections. Instead, they are highlighted in *Favorites* as special pieces in their own right.
