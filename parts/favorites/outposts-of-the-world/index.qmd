# Outposts of the World

*Some postcards journey from places few have seen—remote stations, isolated islands, or the farthest reaches of the world. These cards are more than souvenirs; they are traces of human presence at the edges of geography, glimpses of life where most maps fade into blankness.*

Can you believe there are active volcanoes here? Mt. Erebus is always smoking and even erupts tiny amounts of gold!

Sent by a fellow Redditor stationed at [McMurdo Station in Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station). This postcard is likely the one that has traveled the farthest — from one of the most extraordinary and remote places on Earth. The sender had offered to mail a limited number of postcards to anyone interested, and I was fortunate enough to secure a spot. In return, I sent him a postcard from Maryland, USA, creating a small but meaningful exchange — two postcards crossing continents and oceans, connecting two strangers at opposite ends of the world.
