# Beyond Paper

*Not all postcards are made of paper. Some arrive crafted from cork, wood, fabric, or other surprising materials, turning a simple card into a tactile keepsake. These postcards carry not only images and words, but also the textures of creativity—proof that memory and message can live in many forms.*

Sent by my colleague at the NIH, Sucheta, while vacationing in Porto, Portugal. This postcard is especially unique — the only one in my collection that isn’t made of paper. Crafted entirely from cork, a material Portugal is renowned for, it features a vibrant mosaic pattern on the front, beautifully capturing the city’s artistic spirit. Its texture and design make it a memorable keepsake, standing out as both a postcard and a small piece of Portugal itself.
