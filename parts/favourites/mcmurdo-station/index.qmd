# McMurdo Station

The very first postcard in this collection is likely the one that has traveled the farthest—and from one of the most extraordinary places on Earth. It came from [McMurdo Station in Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station). A fellow Redditor stationed there offered to mail a limited number of postcards to anyone interested, and I was lucky enough to respond quickly and secure a spot. In return, I sent him a postcard from Maryland, USA, creating a small but meaningful exchange—two postcards crossing continents and oceans, connecting two strangers at opposite ends of the world.
