# PART II: Sent by Friends

This section gathers the postcards Iâ€™ve been fortunate to receive from friends and colleagues during their journeys. Each one is a small reminder that even across distances, a thought can be carried home. For ease of browsing, the cards are arranged alphabetically by the country they were sent from. Some have been set aside for *PART I: Favourites* and are shown there instead.
