Anyway, I would definitely recommend Edinburgh to anybody who is visiting England. I hope you do very soon. Very nice people, nature and food. Best Wishes, Su. PS: Hope and wish you visit all the places in your list "to visit", Su."](royal-mile-edinburgh-back-address-crop.webp){fig-alt="Back of the postcard" group="edinburgh-su"}
