This postcard came from my colleague at the NIH, Brian, while he was vacationing in Croatia. I had accidentally given him the wrong address—4550 instead of my real street number, 5440. Somehow, despite the mistake, the card still found its way to me right on time, as if determined that a small mix-up wouldn’t keep it from reaching its destination.
