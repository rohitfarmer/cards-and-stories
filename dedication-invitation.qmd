# Dedication & Invitation {.unnumbered}

*This book is dedicated to the friends who never forgot to send a card, and to the journeys that continue to shape these pages.*

This book is meant to be ever-evolving, just like the journeys it reflects. If you would like to be part of its story, I warmly invite you to send me a postcard from your own travels. Each card will find a place among these pages, carrying your story forward and keeping this collection alive with new voices, places, and memories. Please write to me at [rohit@rohitfarmer.com](mailto:rohit@rohitfarmer.com) for my mailing address.
